  .SYNOPSIS
  Starts a logman trace

  .DESCRIPTION
  This script stops and deletes a previously existing trace with the same name and then
  starts a specifically named (testgate) logman trace used by the gated build to collect ETW events

  .PARAMETER TraceFile
  Specifies the trace file for event collection

  .EXAMPLE
  PS> .\start_trace.ps1 -TraceFile "d:\x\log.etl"
